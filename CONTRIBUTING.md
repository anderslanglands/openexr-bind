Overview
========

Hello, and welcome to the openexr-bind project. We are happy that you are
interested in participating in the project, and we hope that we can get you up
and running quickly.

Goals
-----

The goal for the openexr-bind project is as follows:

1. To create an example project for other Rust bindings of VFX libraries that
   (hopefully) showcases how to successfully create bindings for a VFX library.
2. To create an example of the best of what Rust can offer to the VFX industry.
3. To create a solid and the de-facto Rust bindings for OpenEXR.

Communication
=============

The main ways to communicate with the openexr-binding project are as follow:

- [ASWF Slack](https://slack.aswf.io/) under the `#rust` channel.
- [Rust Working Group mailing list](wg-rust@lists.aswf.io)
- [GitHub issues](https://github.com/vfx-rs/openexr-bind/issues)

The ASWF Slack channel is not archived, so any important conversations may be
lost. It is recommended to move them to the mailing list, or to create an issue
in GitHub.

Help Request
------------

If you are having issues with building or using the project, it is recommended
to use the [mailing list](wg-rust@lists.aswf.io) to ask. The Slack channel can
also work, but the communication can easily be lost due to the nature of real
time chats.

How to Report a Bug
-------------------

openexr-bind uses
[GitHub's issue tracking system](https://github.com/vfx-rs/openexr-bind/issues)
for bugs and enhancements. When submitting a bug, it is important to try to
figure out if the bug is an issue in the wrapped C++ library, or in the binding
itself. For example, if a C++ example that uses the same APIs as the Rust
binding, but produces a different result, then the issue is likely with the
bindings. However, if the bug is with the OpenEXR library, then please
[submit an issue with the OpenEXR project](https://github.com/AcademySoftwareFoundation/openexr/issues).

Also, when submitting a report, please state the version of the bindings used,
operating system, Rust version, and any other information that describes what
you did, what happened, and what you expected to happen.

How to Contribute a Bug Fix or Change

It is requested that a Pull Request in GitHub is attached to an issue. As much
as possible, issues should represent a problem (bug or feature request), and the
pull request represents a potential fix for the issue. This isn't a strict
requirement, but is helpful in keeping the discussions organized.
