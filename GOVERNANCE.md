# OpenEXR Project Roles and Responsibilities

The openexr-bind project is a product of the Rust Working Group,
which is a working group that is part of the Academy Software Foundation
and relies on the ASWF governance policies, supported by the Linux Foundation.

There are three primary project roles: Contributors submit code to the
project; Committers approve code to be included into the project; and
the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) provides overall high-level
project guidance.

- [Committers](#Committers)
- [Technical Steering Committee](#Technical-Steering-Committee)

## Contributors

The OpenEXR project grows and thrives from assistance from
Contributors.  Contributors include anyone in the community that
submits code, documentation, or other technical artifacts to the
project. However, such contributions must be approved by a project
Committer before they become a part of the project.

Anyone can be a Contributor. You need no formal approval from the
project, beyond the legal forms.

### How to Become a Contributor

- Review the coding standards to ensure your contribution is in line
  with the project's coding and styling guidelines.

- Sign the Individual CLA, or have your organization sign the Corporate CLA.

- Submit your code as a PR with the appropriate DCO sign-off.

## Committers

Project Committers have merge access on the openexr-bind GitHub repository
and are responsible for approving submissions by Contributors.

### Committer Responsibilities

Typical activities of a Committer include:

- Helping users and novice contributors.

- Ensuring a response to questions posted to the
  wg-rust@lists.aswf.io mailing list.

- Contributing code and documentation changes that improve the
  project.

- Reviewing and commenting on issues and pull requests.

- Ensuring that changes and new code meet acceptable standards and are
  in the long-term interest of the project.

- Participation in working groups.

- Merging pull requests.

### How to Become a Committer

Any existing Committer can nominate an individual making significant
and valuable contributions to the openexr-bind project to become a new
Committer.  New committers are approved by vote of the TSC.

If you are interested in becomming a Committer, contact the TSC at
through the mailing list (wg-rust@lists.aswf.io).
